## Dependencies

- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (for Fabric versions) 

## Building from Source

### Requirements
- Java 21 (Amazon Corretto 21 recommended)
- Gradle 8.12+

### Standard Build (Windows, Linux, Intel Mac)

For Windows, Linux, and Intel-based Macs, just build normally - the official Devolay library includes all necessary natives.

```bash
./gradlew clean :fabric:build
```

### Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) macOS - Custom Devolay Build Required

The official Devolay library does not include arm64 macOS natives. Use our fork which includes the necessary modifications:

1. **Clone and build Devolay with arm64 support:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tererun/devolay.git
   cd devolay
   
   # Create NDI SDK headers directory
   mkdir -p ndi-sdk/include
   
   # Get NDI headers from obs-ndi (or NDI SDK if you have it)
   curl -o ndi-sdk/include/Processing.NDI.Lib.h https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obs-ndi/obs-ndi/master/headers/Processing.NDI.Lib.h
   curl -o ndi-sdk/include/Processing.NDI.structs.h https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obs-ndi/obs-ndi/master/headers/Processing.NDI.structs.h
   curl -o ndi-sdk/include/Processing.NDI.utilities.h https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obs-ndi/obs-ndi/master/headers/Processing.NDI.utilities.h
   ```

2. **Build and install to local Maven:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :devolay-natives:build :devolay-java:publishToMavenLocal
   ```

### Building MC-NDI

```bash
cd MC-NDI-2

# Set JAVA_HOME if needed
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java21

# Build Fabric version
./gradlew clean :fabric:build

# Output jar will be in fabric/build/libs/
```

### Notes
- The project uses `mavenLocal()` to find the custom Devolay build
- Forge support is currently disabled (1.21.8 uses NeoForge)
- Minecraft 1.21.8 requires Java 21
